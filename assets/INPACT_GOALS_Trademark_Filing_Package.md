## PART 1: PRELIMINARY TRADEMARK SEARCH RESULTS

### INPACT™ - Search Findings

**Status:** ⚠️ MODERATE RISK - Existing commercial use identified

**Conflicts Identified:**

1. **Inpact Learning** (inpactlearning.com)
   - Business: Workforce assessment, training facilitation, web-based training
   - Industry: Education & Training (Class 41 territory)
   - Est. 30+ years in business
   - **Risk Level:** MODERATE - Direct overlap in education/training
   - **Mitigation:** Your specific use case (AI infrastructure frameworks) differs from general workforce training

2. **INPACT Software** (Crunchbase listing)
   - Business: Restaurant industry operating platform
   - Industry: Software/Technology (Class 42 territory)
   - Focus: Business intelligence, POS technology
   - **Risk Level:** LOW-MODERATE - Different industry vertical
   - **Mitigation:** Healthcare focus vs. restaurant focus provides differentiation

3. **INPACT Grant** (Indiana University School of Medicine)
   - Context: Medical education curriculum program
   - **Risk Level:** LOW - Educational use, not commercial trademark

**Overall INPACT™ Assessment:**
- **Likelihood of Approval:** 60-70% without modifications
- **Recommended Strategy:** File with detailed description emphasizing "AI agent infrastructure" and "data architecture readiness frameworks"
- **Potential Challenges:** May receive Office Action requiring clarification to distinguish from Inpact Learning
- **Backup Options:** Consider "INPACT Framework" or "AI-INPACT" if needed

---

### GOALS™ - Search Findings

**Status:** ⚠️ HIGH RISK - Common word with existing trademark

**Conflicts Identified:**

1. **"YOUR GOALS. OUR EXPERTISE."** - REGISTERED TRADEMARK
   - Owner: TPR Education IP Holdings, LLC
   - Registration Number: 5237392
   - Serial Number: 86238864
   - Classes: 41 (Education) & 42 (Software)
   - Goods/Services: Educational software, test prep materials, training services
   - **Risk Level:** MODERATE - Similar territory but different phrase structure
   - **Mitigation:** "GOALS" alone may be distinguished from phrase mark

2. **Generic/Descriptive Usage:**
   - "SMART GOALS" framework (widely used in education - not trademarked)
   - "GOALS Framework" appears in multiple educational contexts
   - **Risk Level:** HIGH - Generic use could weaken trademark claim
   - **Challenge:** USPTO may view "GOALS" as descriptive of goal-setting services

**Overall GOALS™ Assessment:**
- **Likelihood of Approval:** 40-50% as standalone mark
- **Recommended Strategy:** 
  - File as "GOALS Framework" or "AI-GOALS" for better distinctiveness
  - Emphasize specific application to "operational excellence in AI infrastructure"
  - Provide evidence of secondary meaning through book publication and platform use
- **Alternative Approaches:**
  - Stylized logo mark incorporating "GOALS" design
  - Consider "GOALS Framework™" throughout book to build brand recognition

---

### Search Methodology Used:
1. USPTO database search (indirect - via web search due to access limitations)
2. Commercial use search across education and software sectors
3. Common law trademark search
4. Industry-specific framework naming conventions
5. Domain name availability check (pending)

### Key Findings Summary:

| Mark | Existing Conflicts | Risk Level | Recommended Action |
|------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| INPACT™ | 2 commercial uses | MODERATE | File with detailed description |
| GOALS™ | 1 registered TM + generic use | HIGH | Consider modification or stylization |
