# ARCHITECTURE OF TRUST - QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE

## THE FRAMEWORK

**Architecture of Trust** = Internal structural metaphor unifying three pillars

```

## THE THREE PILLARS

### Pillar 1: INPACT™
**Purpose:** What agents need (trust requirements)
**Dimensions:** Instant, Natural, Permitted, Adaptive, Contextual, Transparent
**Chapters:** Introduced Ch 0, Deep-dive Ch 2, Referenced throughout
**Diagram:** Required in Ch 0, 2

### Pillar 2: 7-Layer Architecture
**Purpose:** How to build it (technical blueprint)
**Layers:** Storage → Real-Time → Semantic → Intelligence → Governance → Observability → Orchestration
**Chapters:** Introduced Ch 0, Built Ch 4-6, Referenced throughout
**Diagram:** Required in Ch 0, 4

### Pillar 3: GOALS™
**Purpose:** How to measure success (operational targets)
**Dimensions:** Governance, Observability, Availability, Lexicon, Solid
**Chapters:** Introduced Ch 0, Built Ch 7, Validated Ch 8, Referenced throughout
**Diagram:** Required in Ch 0, 7

## USAGE RULES

### Capitalization
✅ "Architecture of Trust" (first use in chapter)
✅ "the architecture" (subsequent uses)
❌ "architecture of trust" (wrong)

### First Introduction (Ch 0)
"The Architecture of Trust provides a comprehensive blueprint for agent-ready infrastructure. This architecture rests on three pillars: INPACT™ defines what agents need, 7-Layer Architecture specifies how to build it, and GOALS™ establishes how to measure success."

### Subsequent Chapters
"[After triad diagram] In this chapter, we focus on [INPACT/7-Layers/GOALS], the [first/second/third] pillar of the Architecture of Trust."

### Architectural Vocabulary
- Foundation, pillars, capstone
- Blueprint, structure, build
- Layers, stack, components
- Integrated, unified, systematic

## DIAGRAM REQUIREMENTS

### REQUIRED (show full triad)
- Chapter 0: First introduction
- Chapter 2: INPACT™ pillar highlighted
- Chapter 4: 7-Layer pillar highlighted
- Chapter 7: GOALS™ pillar highlighted

### OPTIONAL (simplified or verbal)
- Chapters 1, 3: Verbal only
- Chapters 5-6: Highlight 7-Layer focus
- Chapter 8: Show complete triad (all three validated)
- Chapters 9-12: Verbal reference

## CROSS-PILLAR CONNECTIONS

### How Pillars Relate
**INPACT™ → 7-Layers:** Requirements drive architecture
- "Instant (I) requires Layer 2 real-time fabric"
- "Natural (N) requires Layers 3-4 semantic + intelligence"
- "Permitted (P) requires Layer 5 governance"
- "Transparent (T) requires Layer 6 observability"

**7-Layers → GOALS™:** Infrastructure enables measurement
- "Layer 5 governance measured by Governance (G)"
- "Layer 6 operations measured by Observability (O)"
- "Layer 2 performance validated by Availability (A)"

**GOALS™ → INPACT™:** Measurement validates trust
- "Governance (G) confirms Permitted (P) fulfillment"
- "Observability (O) validates Transparent (T) compliance"

## CHAPTER PROGRESSION

### Foundation Phase (Ch 0-3)
**Language:** "We'll build...", "establishing the need..."
**Focus:** Introduce concept, motivate architecture

### Construction Phase (Ch 4-6)
**Language:** "Now we construct...", "building layer by layer..."
**Focus:** Build 7-Layer pillar in detail (complete by Week 10)

### Validation Phase (Ch 7-8)
**Language:** "The final pillar...", "with all three complete..."
**Focus:** Add GOALS™ framework, validate operations (Weeks 11-12)

### Implementation Phase (Ch 9-12)
**Language:** "The complete architecture, ready for your organization..."
**Focus:** 90-Day roadmap, technology selection, domain guidance, sustainability

## VS. VERT FRAMEWORK

### Architecture of Trust
- Operational framework
- Three pillars
- Reader-facing
- About building

### VERT
- Quality certification
- Four dimensions
- Internal QA
- About validating

**NEVER mix them:** VERT validates the Architecture of Trust

## WRITING CHECKLIST

For every chapter:
- [ ] Which pillar(s) does this chapter address?
- [ ] Show or reference triad diagram?
- [ ] Use "Architecture of Trust" on first mention?
- [ ] Include architectural language?
- [ ] Show cross-pillar connections?
- [ ] Bridge to next chapter architecturally?

## KEY PHRASES BY CHAPTER

**Ch 0:** "We'll build an Architecture of Trust with three integrated pillars..."
**Ch 1:** "Without a comprehensive architecture, 95% fail..."
**Ch 2:** "The first pillar, INPACT™, defines what agents need..."
**Ch 3:** "The transformation decision: build agent-ready infrastructure..."
**Ch 4:** "Now we construct the second pillar, the 7-Layer technical architecture..."
**Ch 5:** "Intelligence layers bring understanding to our foundation..."
**Ch 6:** "With trust and orchestration layers complete, the 7-Layer pillar stands finished..."
**Ch 7:** "The third pillar, GOALS™, ensures lasting operational excellence..."
**Ch 8:** "The Architecture of Trust in action: Echo's operations validate all three pillars..."
**Ch 9:** "Your 90-day roadmap to building the Architecture of Trust..."
**Ch 12:** "The complete Architecture of Trust, now operational in production..."
